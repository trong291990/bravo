                                    While touring you will have the benefit of your own private vehicle (unless stated otherwise). With no waiting for other people you can travel at your leisure and maximise your time sightseeing. You will have a separate guide and driver to ensure you always have personal attention, although transfers may sometimes be without a guide. Travel between destinations will usually be by flight due to the distances involved with trains also an option. These connections are unguided; however you will enjoy private transfers to and from airports with your guide on-hand to assist with check-in.
